  sentences:
  - "Excuse me, we are travelers passing through this area. We've heard about some
    disturbances here and wanted to check if everything is alright. What\u2019s going
    on?"
  - "It\u2019s been a rough time. Our leader, Dashi, is very ill. We believe the
    artifact that we recently acquired from the mushroom village can heal him."
  - An artifact? What kind of artifact is it? Is it shiny?
  - "It\u2019s said to hold great power. Our hope is that it can cure Dashi of his
    disease."
  - That sound serious. How is Dashi doing now?
  - "He\u2019s stable for now, but we need to find a way to use the artifact properly.
    The knowledge on how to use it was lost a long time ago. Dashi and his bodyguard
    have gone to the Ice Land to seek the Woolly Mammoth, hoping it might have the
    knowledge we need."
  - That sounds challenging. We hope Dashi gets better soon. Is there anything we
    can do to help? Or are we just supposed to stand here?
  - Just keep your eyes and ears open. If you hear anything about how to use the
    artifact, let us know. Maybe Ci can help you. She knows about the Ice Land and
    the Woolly Mammoth.
  - We will. Thanks for the information.
