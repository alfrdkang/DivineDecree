  sentences:
  - "We\u2019ve got a lot to think about. Helping the DSS could mean assisting Dashi
    in his quest, but the village also needs the artifact to protect themselves."
  - "I\u2019m conflicted too. Not that you\u2019d notice. We should consider a faster
    way to get to the tundra. We can defeat the Tree Boss at the rune and use its
    teleporter to get there quickly. Seeking out the Woolly Mammoth might give us
    the clarity we need. It could provide us with the truth about the artifact and
    help us decide where our help is most needed."
  - "That makes sense. Let\u2019s head back to the rune, defeat the Tree Boss, and
    use the teleporter. Getting to the Ice Land quickly will allow us to seek out
    the Woolly Mammoth and understand the full picture."
