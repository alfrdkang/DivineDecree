  sentences:
  - "So, you\u2019ve journeyed far to stand before me."
  - "You\u2019ve walked a path not meant for you, shaping a world that is not your
    own. Eldoria is not where you belong."
  - ...
  - "Yet, fate has taken a turn. Dashi now possesses an artifact of immense power\u2014one
    that could unravel the very fabric of Eldoria."
  - Though it pains me to admit, the people of this realm may need your strength.
  - But as you are a foreigner to these lands, I offer you a choice.
  - "Stay, and lend your hand to preserve Eldoria\u2026"
  - Or return to the world you know.
  - Should you choose to depart, I hold the power to send you back.
  - The decision lies with you.
