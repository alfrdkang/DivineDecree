  sentences:
  - "I overheard your conversation. The Ice Cave in the tundra is where Dashi and
    his bodyguard went. We have a hideout there where you can find other DSS members
    who might provide more information about the Woolly Mammoth. It's a dangerous
    journey, but if you\u2019re determined, I can provide you with more details."
  - That would be very helpful. Thank you, Ci.
  - "You're welcome. Be careful on your journey. The tundra is treacherous, and not
    everyone is friendly. Look for a small cave entrance hidden by large icicles;
    that\u2019s where the hideout is."
  - "We\u2019ll keep that in mind. Do you have any advice for dealing with the Woolly
    Mammoth if we encounter it? Not that I need it, but you might."
  - The Woolly Mammoth is ancient and wise, but also wary of outsiders. Approach
    with respect and caution. Show that you mean no harm, and it might help you.
  - Understood. We appreciate the guidance, Ci. We should get going.
