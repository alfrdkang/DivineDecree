  sentences:
  - 'I overheard your conversation. The Ice Cave in the tundra is where Dashi and
    his bodyguard went. '
  - 'We have a hideout there where you can find other DSS members who might provide
    more information about the Woolly Mammoth. '
  - "It's a dangerous journey, but if you\u2019re determined, I can provide you with
    more details."
  - That would be very helpful. Thank you, Ci.
  - 'You''re welcome. Be careful on your journey. The tundra is treacherous, and
    not everyone is friendly. '
  - "Look for a small cave entrance hidden by large icicles; that\u2019s where the
    hideout is."
  - "We\u2019ll keep that in mind. Do you have any advice for dealing with the Woolly
    Mammoth if we encounter it? Not that I need it, but you might."
  - The Woolly Mammoth is ancient and wise, but also wary of outsiders. Approach
    with respect and caution. Show that you mean no harm, and it might help you.
  - Understood. We appreciate the guidance, Ci. We should get going.
